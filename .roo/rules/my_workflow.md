# these are my rules

1. Before I start working, I first check with github, if I'm having the latest state.
2. When I'm done working on something and it works (it can be before I'm done with a task), I commit the code.
3. After marking a task or subtask as done, I push the code.
4. If I consider the (sub)task is done, I open a PR if I was working on a different branch.
5. If I say "go working", get the next task and start working on it.
6. If you're done with one (sub)task, then terminate.
7. Always use conventional commit when doing commit. Only add a longer body if the case looks interesting. You judge.
