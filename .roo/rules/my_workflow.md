# these are my rules

1. Before I start working, I first check with github, if I'm having the latest state.
2. When I'm done working on something and it works (it can be before I'm done with a task), I commit the code.
3. After marking a task or subtask as done, I push the code.
4. If I consider the (sub)task is done, I open a PR if I was working on a different branch.
5. If I say "go working", get the next task and start working on it.
